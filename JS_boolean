A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.

Boolean Values
Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.

The Boolean() Function
You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:

Example
Boolean(10 > 9)
Or even easier:

Example
(10 > 9)
10 > 9
Comparisons and Conditions
The chapter JS Comparisons gives a full overview of comparison operators.

The chapter JS If Else gives a full overview of conditional statements.

Here are some examples:

Operator	Description	Example
==	equal to	if (day == "Monday")
>	greater than	if (salary > 9000)
<	less than	if (age < 18)
The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions.
